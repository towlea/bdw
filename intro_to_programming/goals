p "Goals for Intro to Programming: As an undergrad I did the Technology, Arts & Media Minor at CU Boulder. Taking classes like Digital Media 1 & 2 I was able to gain some hands on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a little PHP and a little MySQL. Though I feel comfortable writing code in DreamWeaver, I would love to learn the proper/industry-practiced way to develop web-based applications. (One thing I really do enjoy about creating websites is trouble shooting; figuring out the problem and making the page work is always a very rewarding feeling.) Although I am most interested in taking a creative path, I still feel that it is very important to have a good understanding of back-end development. This way I can act as a liason between designers and developers by understanding what is happening through the duration of a project. In the end I feel that having a well-rounded skill set will allow me to be a better candidate for a job. I'm excited to learn!"
